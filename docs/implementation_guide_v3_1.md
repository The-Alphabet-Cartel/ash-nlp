# NLP Configuration Migration Implementation Guide v3.1

## Overview
This guide outlines the complete recode of the configuration system for clean JSON + environment variable management with JSON defaults and ENV overrides pattern.

**Project Scope**: This migration focuses exclusively on the **NLP Server (`ash/ash-nlp`)** configuration system. The Discord Bot (`ash/ash-bot`) will be addressed in a future phase after the NLP server's JSON configuration migration is fully completed. The NLP server must be running correctly with clean JSON configuration before any bot-related work begins.

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ **PHASE 2 COMPLETE - MODELS MANAGER MIGRATED SUCCESSFULLY** - The ModelsManager v3.1 is successfully running from `managers/models_manager.py` with clean JSON defaults + ENV overrides configuration pattern and standard Python logging. All endpoints tested and detection functional.

## Design Philosophies and Core Principles

### üéØ **Configuration Management Philosophy**
- **JSON as Source of Truth**
  - JSON files contain the default configuration structure and values
- **Environment Variable Overrides**
  - The `.env` file variables override JSON defaults for deployment-specific customization
- **Centralized Configuration Goal**
  - The end goal is to eventually move **ALL** configuration parameters into JSON files for a central configuration management solution
- **No Hot-Loading Required**
  - JSON configuration does not need hot-loading capability at this time
    - May be added in future
- **Standard Python Logging**
  - Logging uses Python's built-in logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
  - The `GLOBAL_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable controls logging verbosity
  - **No custom debug mode logic**
    - Let Python's logging system handle it
  - When set to `DEBUG`: all detailed logs are shown
  - When set to `INFO`: only production-level logs are shown (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- **Implementation Restrictions**
  - For the purposes of this document and implementation guide, we are *ONLY* working with Ash (`ash`) and Ash-NLP (`ash-nlp`)
    - The other submodules (`ash-bot`, `ash-thrash`, `ash-dash`) will be handled separately under their own versions and implementations
- **Knowledge Base**
  - Always assume that the project knowledge base contains incorrect and outdated files and directory structures
    - Ask for current versions of files as needed
  - The only true source for correct and current files and directory structures is the GitHub (https://github.com/the-alphabet-cartel/ash).
    - Always update the GitHub branches when starting a new conversation to see the current files and directory structures.
      - We are working in the "v3.0" GitHub branch of `ash`
      - We are working in the "v3.1" GitHub branch of `ash/ash-nlp`

### üö´ **What We Don't Do**
- **No Bash Scripts**
  - All automation and configuration management is done through Python, Docker, and JSON
- **No Quick Fixes**
  - Always implement proper, complete solutions rather than temporary workarounds
- **No Backward Compatibility**
  - Only forward-looking code
    - No support for legacy patterns or deprecated approaches
- **No Hard-coded Defaults in Code**
  - All defaults should be defined in JSON configuration files
- **No Custom Debug Mode Logic**
  - ~~No `GLOBAL_ENABLE_DEBUG_MODE` variable~~
  - ~~No custom debug checking functions~~
  - Use standard Python logging levels instead

### üîß **Development Standards**
- **Manager-First Architecture**
  - All components must integrate with the clean manager system (ConfigManager, SettingsManager, etc.)
- **Fail-Fast Design**
  - Components that don't support the new architecture should fail with clear error messages
- **Standard Python Logging**
  - Use appropriate logging levels:
    - `logger.debug()`
    - `logger.info()`
    - `logger.warning()`
    - `logger.error()`
    - `logger.critical()`
  - Control logging verbosity through `GLOBAL_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
  - All detailed debugging information should use `logger.debug()`
  - All production-relevant information should use `logger.info()` or higher
- **Full Error Handling**
  - No silent failures
    - All errors must be caught, logged, and handled appropriately
- **Modular Code Structure**
  - Separate code into logical modules based on functionality to keep the main codebase clean and maintainable

### üê≥ **Deployment Philosophy**
- **Docker-First**
  - All services run in Docker containers with docker-compose orchestration
- **Environment-Specific Overrides**
  - Use `.env` files to customize deployments without changing JSON configuration
- **Container Restart for Configuration Changes**
  - Configuration changes require container restart
    - No hot-reloading
- **Secrets Management**
  - Sensitive configuration should use Docker secrets or secure environment variables

### üß™ **Testing and Debugging Philosophy**
- **Component Isolation**
  - Each component should be testable independently
- **Detailed Error Reporting**
  - Error messages should be specific and actionable
    - Use appropriate logging levels (`logger.error()`, `logger.critical()`)
- **Configuration Validation**
  - All configuration should be validated at startup with meaningful error messages
    - Use appropriate logging levels for validation results
- **Health Check Integration**
  - All components should report their status through the `/health` endpoint

### üìÅ **File Organization Standards**
- **Docker**
  - The Dockerfile for building Ash-NLP lives in `ash/ash-nlp/Dockerfile`
  - The `docker-compose.yml` file we use to start all of the containers resides in the Ash project root, `ash/docker-compose.yml`
- **ENVironmental Variables**
  - The `.env` file for our variables lives in the Ash project root, `ash/.env`
  - Our `.env.template` is our governing file for all environmental variables and is what our `.env` file is based on
    - All changes to environmental variables *must* be made in the `ash/.env.template` file
- **Analyzers**
  - All analyzers, and supporting scripts for said analyzers, shall live in `ash/ash-nlp/analysis/` with descriptive filenames
- **API Endpoints**
  - All API Endpoint files shall live in `ash/ash-nlp/api/` with descriptive filenames ending in `_endpoints.py`
  - (migrated from `endpoints/`)
- **Configuration Files**
  - All JSON configuration files shall live in `ash/ash-nlp/config/` with descriptive filenames
- **ash/ash-nlp/data**
  - Data Storage
    - (future implementation)
- **Documentation**
  - All documentation shall live in `ash/ash-nlp/docs`
- **ash/ash-nlp/learning_data**
  - Learning Data Storage
- **ash/ash-nlp/logs**
  - Logging Storage
- **Manager Classes**
  - All Manager files and manager classes shall live in `ash/ash-nlp/managers/` with descriptive filenames ending in `_manager.py`
- **Models**
  - **MIGRATING**: The Model (`ml_models.py`) is being migrated to `ash/ash-nlp/managers/models_manager.py` ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
  - **NEXT**: The Pydantic (`pydantic_models.py`) will be migrated to `ash/ash-nlp/managers/pydantic_manager.py` ‚è≥ **PLANNED FOR PHASE 2B**
  - Model caching is located in `ash/ash-nlp/models/cache`
- **Debug / Testing Scripts**
  - All Debug and/or Testing scripts shall live in `ash/ash-nlp/tests/` with descriptive filenames beginning with either `test_` or `debug_`
    - To be coded in Python only (no bash scripting)
- **Utility Scripts**
  - Utility and helper scripts shall live in `ash/ash-nlp/utils` using descriptive filenames
- **Clean Import Structure**
  - All imports shall be wrapped in "try-catch" blocks with detailed logging

### üîÑ **Migration Strategy**
- **Incremental JSON Migration**
  - Gradually move configuration from environment variables to JSON files
- **Maintain Override Capability**
  - Always preserve the ability for environment variables to override JSON defaults
- **Phase-Based Approach**
  - Migrate configuration in logical phases
    - Phase 1: Core Systems ‚Üí Analysis Components ‚Üí Performance & Advanced ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
    - Phase 2A: Models Manager Migration ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
    - Phase 2B: Pydantic Manager Migration ‚è≥ **NEXT**
- **Validation At Each Step**
  - Ensure each migration phase is fully tested before proceeding to the next
- **Update Implementation Documentation At Each Step**
  - This document, `ash/ash-nlp/docs/implementation_guide_v3_1.md`, shall be kept up to date at each step of the migration
  - It shall document:
    - Our core design standards and philosophies
    - What we've accomplished thus far in the migration
    - What we have left to accomplish
    - Problems encountered
      - Fixes implemented for them
    - Any miscellaneous information that may be needed to assist in this migration

These principles guide all development decisions and ensure consistency across the entire Ash ecosystem. When in doubt, refer back to these philosophies to determine the correct approach.

## Key Features Working

### JSON Defaults + Environment Overrides ‚úÖ
```
JSON Configuration (defaults) ‚Üê Environment Variables (overrides)
```

**Configuration Flow**:
1. JSON files provide **default values** and structure
2. Environment variables **override** JSON values when present
3. ConfigManager handles `${VAR_NAME}` substitution automatically
4. Missing environment variables fall back to JSON defaults

### Clean Manager Architecture ‚úÖ
All components now require manager integration:
- `ModelsManager(config_manager, model_config, hardware_config)` ‚úÖ **WORKING**
- `EnhancedLearningManager(model_manager, config_manager)` ‚úÖ **WORKING**
- `CrisisAnalyzer(model_manager, config_manager, settings_manager, learning_manager)` ‚úÖ **WORKING**
- `PhraseExtractor(model_manager, config_manager, zero_shot_manager)` ‚úÖ **WORKING**

### Configuration Validation ‚úÖ
- Model weights sum to 1.0 ‚úÖ
- All required models present ‚úÖ
- Environment variables properly typed ‚úÖ
- Manager dependencies validated ‚úÖ
- JSON structure validated ‚úÖ

### Environment Variable Substitution ‚úÖ
Perfect substitution working as seen in production:
```
üîÑ DEBUG: Substituting ${NLP_DEPRESSION_MODEL} = MoritzLaurer/deberta-v3-base-zeroshot-v2.0
üîÑ DEBUG: Substituting ${NLP_SENTIMENT_MODEL} = MoritzLaurer/mDeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-xnli
üîÑ DEBUG: Substituting ${NLP_EMOTIONAL_DISTRESS_MODEL} = Lowerated/lm6-deberta-v3-topic-sentiment
‚úÖ DEBUG: Model configuration processing complete
```

### Three Zero-Shot Model Ensemble ‚úÖ
```
üì¶ Loading Depression Model: MoritzLaurer/deberta-v3-base-zeroshot-v2.0
‚úÖ Depression model loaded successfully
üì¶ Loading Sentiment Model: MoritzLaurer/mDeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-xnli
‚úÖ Sentiment model loaded successfully
üì¶ Loading Emotional Distress Model: Lowerated/lm6-deberta-v3-topic-sentiment
‚úÖ Emotional distress model loaded successfully
‚úÖ All three models loaded successfully
```

### Standard Python Logging System ‚úÖ
- **Production Mode** (`GLOBAL_LOG_LEVEL=INFO`): Shows INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- **Debug Mode** (`GLOBAL_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`): Shows all logging levels including DEBUG
- **No Custom Logic**: Uses Python's built-in logging system
- **Appropriate Levels**: 
  - `logger.debug()` for detailed debugging information
  - `logger.info()` for important operational information
  - `logger.warning()` for potential issues
  - `logger.error()` for errors that don't stop execution
  - `logger.critical()` for critical errors
