#### 2. Initial Contact (2-5 minutes)
- **Direct Message**: Reach out privately to avoid public attention

## Understanding AI Analysis

### Analysis Components

#### Crisis Score Interpretation
- **0.0-0.2**: Background monitoring sufficient
- **0.3-0.4**: Increased attention warranted
- **0.5-0.6**: Direct outreach recommended
- **0.7-0.8**: Immediate intervention needed
- **0.9-1.0**: Emergency protocols activated

#### Confidence Score Meaning
- **0.9-1.0**: Very high confidence - trust AI assessment
- **0.7-0.8**: Good confidence - verify with context review
- **0.5-0.6**: Moderate confidence - human judgment crucial
- **0.3-0.4**: Low confidence - requires careful evaluation
- **0.0-0.2**: Very low confidence - likely false positive

#### Detected Categories
- **emotional_distress**: General emotional pain or suffering
- **depression_indicators**: Signs of depressive thoughts or feelings
- **anxiety_patterns**: Anxiety-related expressions
- **isolation_indicators**: Signs of social withdrawal or loneliness
- **self_harm_risk**: Potential self-harm indicators
- **suicidal_ideation**: Suicide-related thoughts or expressions

### AI Model Details
The system uses three AI models working together:
- **Model 1**: Depression and mental health focused analysis
- **Model 2**: Emotional tone and sentiment analysis
- **Model 3**: General distress and crisis pattern detection

When models agree (consensus), confidence is higher. Disagreement between models may indicate complex situations requiring human judgment.

## LGBTQIA+ Specific Considerations

### Community-Aware Response

#### Identity Affirmation
- **Use correct pronouns** as stated in user profiles or previous conversations
- **Respect chosen names** and identity expressions

- **Coming out stress** and family rejection concerns
- **Discrimination experiences** in work, school, or community settings
- **Identity exploration** and questioning periods
- **Medical transition** stress and healthcare access issues
- **Community belonging** and acceptance concerns

#### Specialized Resources
Maintain connections to LGBTQIA+-specific crisis resources:

### Language Sensitivity

#### Affirming Language

## Quality Assurance

### Feedback to AI System

#### When to Provide Feedback
- **False Positives**: AI flagged crisis when none existed
- **False Negatives**: AI missed crisis that human identified
- **Correct Classifications**: Confirm accurate assessments

#### Feedback Process
1. **Document the case** with original message and AI analysis
2. **Submit feedback** through admin interface or designated process
3. **Include context** explaining why assessment was incorrect/correct
4. **Note community impact** of the false positive/negative

### Performance Monitoring

#### Key Metrics to Track
- **Response time** from AI alert to team contact
- **Intervention success rate** (positive user engagement)
- **False positive/negative rates** based on team assessment
- **Resource utilization** effectiveness
- **User satisfaction** with support received

#### Weekly Team Review
- **Case analysis** of challenging situations
- **AI performance** discussion and feedback
- **Protocol updates** based on experience
- **Training needs** identification
- **Community feedback** integration

---

## Emergency Protocols

### Immediate Danger Assessment

#### High-Risk Indicators
- **Specific suicide plans** with means and timeline
- **Imminent self-harm** statements
- **Goodbye messages** to community
- **Active substance use** during crisis
- **Complete isolation** from support systems

#### Emergency Actions
1. **Immediate engagement** - do not delay response
2. **Stay online** with the user if possible
3. **Encourage professional contact** - provide crisis line numbers
4. **Contact emergency services** if user shares location and imminent danger
5. **Team alert** - notify other team members immediately
6. **Document everything** for follow-up and learning
