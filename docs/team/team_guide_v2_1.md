As a Crisis Response team member, you play a crucial role in making Ash's AI detection smarter and more accurate for our community. The v2.1 system learns from your feedback to reduce false positives and catch missed crisis indicators.

### Essential Commands You'll Use

```bash
# Check learning system status
/learning_stats

# Report when Ash incorrectly flagged something as crisis
/report_false_positive

# Report when Ash missed something that should have been flagged  
/report_false_negative

# View your recent learning contributions
/my_learning_contributions

# Get help with learning system
/learning_help
```

### Daily Workflow Overview

1. **🔔 Receive Crisis Alert** - Ash detects potential crisis and pings Crisis Response
2. **🔍 Assess Situation** - Review the flagged message and context
3. **💬 Respond to Community Member** - Provide appropriate support
4. **🧠 Provide AI Feedback** - Help the system learn from any detection errors
5. **📊 Monitor Improvements** - Track how the system gets better over time

## 🧠 Understanding AI Crisis Detection

### How the AI System Works

**Multi-Layer Analysis Process:**
```
User Message → DeBERTa Depression Model → RoBERTa Sentiment Analysis
     ↓                    ↓                       ↓
Context Analysis → Community Learning → Final Crisis Assessment
     ↓                    ↓                       ↓
Crisis Level Rating → Confidence Score → Alert to Crisis Response Team
```

### Crisis Levels Explained

| Level | Description | AI Confidence | Typical Response |
|-------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| **🔴 HIGH** | Immediate intervention needed | 80-95% | Immediate outreach, may involve emergency resources |
| **🟡 MEDIUM** | Monitoring and support needed | 60-80% | Check-in message, offer resources, monitor |
| **🟢 LOW** | General wellness check | 40-60% | Gentle support, community engagement |
| **⚪ NONE** | No crisis indicators detected | <40% | No action needed |

### What the AI Looks For

**Primary Crisis Indicators:**
- Explicit suicidal ideation or self-harm mentions
- Severe hopelessness or despair language
- Social isolation or withdrawal statements
- Substance abuse indicators in distress context
- Major life crisis combined with emotional overwhelm

**Community-Specific Patterns (Learned):**
- LGBTQIA+ identity crisis situations
- Community terminology and expressions
- Subtle distress signals unique to our server
- Context-dependent crisis indicators

### Context Filtering Intelligence

The AI has learned to **NOT** flag these contexts:
- Gaming references ("this boss is killing me")
- Entertainment discussions ("that movie was insane")
- Casual hyperbole ("I'm dying of laughter")
- Academic or news discussions about crisis topics
- Historical or fictional content discussions

---

## 🧠 Learning System Operations

### Why Your Feedback Matters

**Every piece of feedback you provide:**
- ✅ Reduces false positives by teaching context
- ✅ Improves detection of subtle crisis language
- ✅ Adapts to LGBTQIA+ and community-specific terminology
- ✅ Makes the system more accurate for our unique community
- ✅ Saves Crisis Response team time and energy

### Reporting False Positives

**When to Report:**
```bash
# Use /report_false_positive when Ash flagged something that wasn't actually a crisis

# Examples of common false positives to report:
"That presentation killed me" (work context)
"I'm dead tired" (fatigue, not crisis)
"This game is driving me insane" (gaming frustration)
"Feeling suicidal about this exam" (academic stress hyperbole)
```

**How to Report:**
```bash
/report_false_positive message:"that boss fight destroyed me" context:"gaming" severity:2

# Fields:
# message: The exact text Ash flagged
# context: What it was actually about (gaming, work, entertainment, etc.)
# severity: 1-10 scale of how wrong the detection was (10 = very wrong)
```

### Reporting False Negatives

**When to Report:**
```bash
# Use /report_false_negative when Ash missed something that should have been flagged

# Examples of missed crisis indicators:
"Not doing great tbh" (subtle distress expression)
"Everything feels pointless lately" (depression indicator)
"Can't keep pretending I'm okay" (masked crisis)
"Thinking about ending the pain" (veiled suicidal ideation)
```

**How to Report:**
```bash
/report_false_negative message:"not doing great tbh" should_be:"medium" context:"subtle distress" severity:6

# Fields:
# message: The text Ash missed
# should_be: What level it should have been (low, medium, high)
# context: Why it should have been detected
# severity: 1-10 scale of how serious the miss was
```

### Understanding Learning Impact

**Immediate Effects (Within Hours):**
- Pattern adjustments for similar messages
- Context understanding improvements
- Community-specific terminology recognition

**Long-term Effects (Over Weeks):**
- Reduced false positive rates
- Better detection of subtle crisis indicators
- Improved accuracy for your community's unique language patterns

```python
# Good learning feedback examples:

# False Positive Report:
/report_false_positive 
message: "this deadline is killing me"
context: "work stress, not crisis"
severity: 7
notes: "common work expression, shouldn't trigger high alert"

# False Negative Report:
/report_false_negative
message: "don't think anyone would miss me"
should_be: "high"
context: "subtle suicidal ideation"
severity: 9  
notes: "community member expressing burden thoughts"
