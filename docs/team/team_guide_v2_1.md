---

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This guide provides crisis response teams with essential information about how the Ash NLP Server enhances our community's crisis detection and support capabilities.

### What Is the NLP Server?

The Ash NLP Server is an advanced artificial intelligence system that analyzes Discord messages in real-time to identify potential mental health crises, self-harm indicators, and community members who may need support.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Real-time Analysis**: Every message is analyzed within 200ms
- **Risk Classification**: Categorizes concerns as High, Medium, or Low priority
- **Context Understanding**: Distinguishes between gaming frustration and genuine crisis
- **Learning System**: Continuously improves based on team feedback
- **Privacy Protection**: No messages are stored permanently

## ðŸš¨ Crisis Detection System

### Risk Level Classifications

**ðŸ”´ High Crisis (Immediate Response Required)**
- **Score Range**: 0.50 - 1.00
- **Response Time**: Immediate (within 5 minutes)
- **Indicators**: 
  - Suicidal ideation ("I want to die", "ending it all")
  - Self-harm references ("cutting myself", "hurting myself")
  - Immediate danger signals ("tonight is the night", "goodbye everyone")
  - Crisis escalation language ("can't take it anymore", "no point living")

**ðŸŸ¡ Medium Crisis (Close Monitoring)**
- **Score Range**: 0.22 - 0.49
- **Response Time**: Within 30 minutes
- **Indicators**:
  - Depression markers ("everything is hopeless", "nothing matters")
  - Anxiety indicators ("panic attacks", "can't breathe")
  - Social isolation ("nobody understands", "completely alone")
  - Identity struggles ("hate who I am", "don't belong anywhere")

**ðŸŸ¢ Low Crisis (Supportive Check-in)**
- **Score Range**: 0.12 - 0.21
- **Response Time**: Within 2 hours
- **Indicators**:
  - Mild mood indicators ("feeling down", "rough day")
  - Stress signals ("overwhelmed", "too much pressure")
  - Gaming frustration ("this game is killing me")
  - General support needs ("need someone to talk to")

### Understanding Detection Accuracy

**Current Performance Metrics:**
- **Overall Accuracy**: 87%
- **High Crisis Detection**: 96% (rarely misses serious situations)
- **False Positive Rate**: 6.2% (low rate of false alarms)
- **Average Analysis Time**: 145ms

**What This Means:**
- The system correctly identifies 96% of high-crisis situations
- About 1 in 16 alerts may be false positives (still worth checking)
- Very rare to miss genuine high-priority situations
- Gaming language usually distinguished from real crisis talk

## ðŸ”„ Learning & Feedback System

### How the Learning System Works

The NLP server continuously learns from team feedback to improve its accuracy and reduce false positives/negatives.

**Feedback Types:**
1. **False Positive**: System flagged a message that wasn't actually concerning
2. **False Negative**: System missed a message that should have been flagged
3. **Correct Classification**: System got it right (reinforces good behavior)
4. **Severity Adjustment**: Right category but wrong priority level

### Providing Feedback

**Through Ash Dashboard:**
1. Review flagged messages in the dashboard
2. Click "Provide Feedback" next to any detection
3. Select feedback type and correct classification
4. Add optional notes about why the detection was incorrect
5. Submit feedback

**Through Discord Commands:**
```
!ash feedback <message_id> false_positive
!ash feedback <message_id> false_negative high_crisis
!ash feedback <message_id> correct
!ash feedback <message_id> adjust medium_crisis
```

**Best Practices for Feedback:**
- **Be Timely**: Provide feedback within 24 hours when possible
- **Be Specific**: Include context about why classification was wrong
- **Focus on Patterns**: Note recurring issues (e.g., specific gaming terminology)
- **Document Context**: Include information about user's typical communication style

### Learning Impact

**Real-time Improvements:**
- Feedback is processed immediately
- Model adjustments applied within 10-15 minutes
- Changes affect future analysis of similar messages
- Learning is preserved across server restarts

**Weekly Learning Reports:**
Teams receive weekly reports showing:
- Number of feedback submissions
- Classification improvements
- Accuracy trend changes
- Identified new language patterns
