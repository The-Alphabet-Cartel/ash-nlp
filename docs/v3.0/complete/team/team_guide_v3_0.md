# Crisis Response Team Guide - Ash NLP v3.0

**A comprehensive guide for crisis response teams using the Three Zero-Shot Model Ensemble system**

---

## üéØ Quick Start for Crisis Response Teams

### What is Ash NLP v3.0?

Ash NLP v3.0 is an AI system that **automatically analyzes Discord messages** to detect potential mental health crises. Instead of relying on a single AI model, it uses **three specialized models** that work together to provide:

- **More accurate crisis detection** (75% vs 61% accuracy)
- **Fewer false alarms** (8% vs 15% false positive rate)
- **Smart escalation** when the AI is uncertain
- **Transparent reasoning** for every decision

### How It Helps Your Team

‚úÖ **Catches crises you might miss** - Works 24/7 monitoring all channels  
‚úÖ **Reduces alert fatigue** - 47% fewer false alarms  
‚úÖ **Provides context** - Shows exactly why it flagged a message  
‚úÖ **Escalates uncertainty** - Asks for human review when models disagree  
‚úÖ **Respects privacy** - Analyzes messages in real-time, doesn't store them

## üß† Understanding the Three-Model System

### The Three AI Models

Think of it like having **three specialists** reviewing each message:

#### 1. üß† Depression Specialist (Primary)
- **What it does**: Looks for clinical signs of depression and suicidal ideation
- **Training**: Specialized in mental health language patterns
- **Strength**: Very good at detecting serious depression indicators
- **Weakness**: May miss non-clinical expressions of distress

#### 2. üí≠ Sentiment Specialist (Context)
- **What it does**: Analyzes emotional tone and context
- **Training**: Understands social media language and expressions
- **Strength**: Catches emotional distress in casual language
- **Weakness**: May overreact to dramatic expressions

#### 3. üò∞ Distress Specialist (Validation)
- **What it does**: Detects general emotional distress signals
- **Training**: Recognizes stress and emotional crisis patterns
- **Strength**: Good at identifying emotional overwhelm
- **Weakness**: Less specific about mental health vs general stress

### How They Work Together

```
Message: "I'm feeling really down and hopeless"

üß† Depression Model: "moderate depression" (60% confidence)
üí≠ Sentiment Model: "negative" (90% confidence)
üò∞ Distress Model: "negative distress" (99% confidence)

‚úÖ All agree it's a crisis ‚Üí HIGH CONFIDENCE response
```

```
Message: "This exam is killing me but I can handle it"

üß† Depression Model: "not depression" (96% confidence) ‚Üê "I can handle it"
üí≠ Sentiment Model: "negative" (69% confidence) ‚Üê "killing me"
üò∞ Distress Model: "negative distress" (93% confidence) ‚Üê mixed signals

‚ö†Ô∏è Models disagree ‚Üí FLAGS FOR HUMAN REVIEW
```

## üö® Crisis Levels Explained

### The Four Crisis Levels

#### üî¥ HIGH Crisis
- **When**: All models agree on severe crisis indicators
- **Examples**: Clear suicidal ideation, immediate danger expressions
- **Action**: Immediate response required, automatic alert
- **Staff Role**: Respond within minutes

#### üü° MEDIUM Crisis  
- **When**: Models mostly agree on moderate crisis signs
- **Examples**: Depression expressions, hopelessness, self-harm hints
- **Action**: Response recommended, monitoring increased
- **Staff Role**: Reach out within hours

#### üü† LOW Crisis
- **When**: Some crisis indicators but mild or uncertain
- **Examples**: Stress expressions, mild depression language
- **Action**: Keep monitoring, gentle check-in
- **Staff Role**: Optional outreach, increased awareness

#### üü¢ NONE (Safe)
- **When**: No crisis indicators detected
- **Examples**: Normal conversation, positive expressions
- **Action**: No immediate action needed
- **Staff Role**: Continue normal community interaction

### Special Cases

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **GAP DETECTED** (Requires Review)
- **When**: Models significantly disagree on crisis level
- **Why Important**: Indicates complex or ambiguous language
- **Examples**: Sarcasm, idioms, mixed emotional messages
- **Staff Role**: **HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED** - Use your judgment

## üìä Reading AI Analysis Reports

### Standard Analysis Response

```json
{
  "crisis_level": "medium",
  "confidence_score": 0.70,
  "needs_response": true,
  "processing_time_ms": 31,
  "reasoning": "Context shows no humor or positive indicators. Strong negative sentiment detected. Depression model indicates moderate risk."
}
```

**Key Fields for Teams**:
- **`crisis_level`**: The final decision (high/medium/low/none)
- **`needs_response`**: Whether team action is recommended
- **`confidence_score`**: How certain the AI is (0.0 - 1.0)
- **`reasoning`**: Human-readable explanation of the decision

### Ensemble Analysis Response

```json
{
  "ensemble_analysis": {
    "predictions": {
      "depression": "moderate",
      "sentiment": "negative", 
      "emotional_distress": "NEGATIVE"
    },
    "confidence_scores": {
      "depression": 0.60,
      "sentiment": 0.90,
      "emotional_distress": 0.99
    },
    "gaps_detected": false,
    "consensus": {
      "prediction": "NEGATIVE",
      "confidence": 0.70,
      "method": "unanimous_consensus"
    }
  },
  "requires_staff_review": false,
  "crisis_level": "medium"
}
```

**Key Fields for Teams**:
- **`gaps_detected`**: Whether models disagreed (if `true`, review needed)
- **`requires_staff_review`**: AI recommendation for human review
- **`consensus.method`**: How the decision was made
- **`predictions`**: What each individual model thought

## üîç Gap Detection: When AI Needs Help

### What is Gap Detection?

Gap detection happens when the three AI models **disagree significantly** about a message. This is actually a **feature, not a bug** - it means the AI recognized that human judgment is needed.

### Types of Gaps

#### 1. **Meaningful Disagreement**
```json
{
  "type": "meaningful_disagreement",
  "crisis_models": ["sentiment", "emotional_distress"],
  "safe_models": ["depression"]
}
```
- **What it means**: Some models see crisis, others see safety
- **Example**: "This test is killing me but I've got this!"
- **Your role**: Use context knowledge to decide

#### 2. **Confidence Disagreement**
```json
{
  "type": "confidence_disagreement", 
  "spread": 0.65,
  "threshold": 0.5
}
```
- **What it means**: Models agree on prediction but confidence varies widely
- **Example**: Unclear sarcasm or cultural references
- **Your role**: Consider community context and user history

### When You See Gap Detection

‚úÖ **DO**: 
- Review the message with full context
- Consider the user's recent activity and relationships
- Use your community knowledge
- Trust your human instincts
- Document your decision for learning

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Automatically assume it's not a crisis
- Ignore the AI completely
- Rush to judgment without context
- Treat gap detection as system failure

## üéØ Best Practices for Crisis Response Teams

### Daily Workflow

#### 1. **Morning Setup** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Check system health
curl http://localhost:8881/health

# Review overnight statistics  
curl http://localhost:8881/stats
```

#### 2. **Active Monitoring**
- **High/Medium alerts**: Respond according to your protocols
- **Gap detection alerts**: Review within 2-4 hours
- **System status**: Monitor dashboard for unusual patterns

#### 3. **End of Day Review** (10 minutes)
- Review any gap detection cases
- Check for missed patterns
- Note any new community language/expressions

### Response Guidelines

#### For HIGH Crisis Alerts
1. **Immediate Action** (within 5 minutes)
2. **Read AI reasoning** to understand what triggered it
3. **Check user context** (recent messages, relationships)
4. **Follow your standard crisis protocol**
5. **Document outcome** for system learning

#### For MEDIUM Crisis Alerts  
1. **Timely Response** (within 2 hours)
2. **Gentle outreach** or increased monitoring
3. **Consider community context**
4. **Escalate if needed**

#### For Gap Detection Cases
1. **Human Review Required** (within 4 hours)
2. **Read all three model predictions**
3. **Consider why models disagreed**
4. **Make informed decision** based on full context
5. **Provide feedback** to improve system

### Escalation Procedures

#### When to Override AI Decisions

**Override to Higher Crisis Level** when:
- You know additional context the AI missed
- User has history of minimizing their struggles  
- Community patterns suggest higher risk
- Your intuition strongly disagrees

**Override to Lower Crisis Level** when:
- Clear sarcasm or humor the AI missed
- Cultural/community expressions AI doesn't understand
- Context clearly indicates safety
- False positive patterns you recognize

#### Documentation

For each override, note:
- **Original AI decision and confidence**
- **Your decision and reasoning** 
- **Context the AI missed**
- **Outcome** (for learning)
