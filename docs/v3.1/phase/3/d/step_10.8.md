# Step 10.8: Consolidate `utils/context_helpers.py`

**Objective**: Create `ContextPatternManager` for semantic analysis

**Scope**: Create new manager for context and semantic analysis:
- Review all functions in `utils/context_helpers.py`
- Create new `ContextPatternManager` following Clean v3.1 patterns
- Migrate context analysis functions to new manager
- Integrate with `CrisisAnalyzer` and `AnalysisParametersManager`
- Create factory function and JSON configuration
- **Apply Rule #7**: Check existing environment variables before creating new ones

**Success Criteria**:
- New `ContextPatternManager` fully functional
- All context analysis functionality centralized
- No remaining references to `utils/context_helpers.py`
- File successfully removed from ecosystem
- Clean v3.1 architecture compliance
- **Prefer no new environment variables** (following Rule #7)
