## 📋 **Phase Overview**

**Phase 3d Status**: **Not Yet Started**

**Objective**: Full audit of the Environmental Variables system and config manager (which handles the env variables for the NLP), their implementation, and making sure that not only are they used appropriately, but work.

**Scope**: This audit covers the entire NLP ecosystem as a whole and therefore all files must be audited for this phase.

**Goals**:
- Removal of non-used variables
- Consolidation of duplicate variables
- Consolidation of similarly functioning / named variables
- Addition of other variables as makes sense for the functionality of the system as a whole
- A clean and comprehensive `.env` file that is documented, and easily used to configure the NLP server
