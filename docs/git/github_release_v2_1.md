## 🧪 Enhanced Testing & Validation

### Comprehensive Test Coverage (v2.1)
- ✅ **15 HIGH crisis scenarios** (97%+ detection required)
- ✅ **12 MEDIUM concern scenarios** (90%+ detection target)  
- ✅ **10 LOW concern scenarios** (80%+ detection target)  
- ✅ **25 NONE scenarios** (enhanced false positive prevention)
- ✅ **Learning system effectiveness** (pattern application validation)
- ✅ **Context intelligence** (gaming/academic/work/entertainment filtering)
- ✅ **Hardware optimization** (GPU/CPU performance validation)

### Production Testing Examples
```python
# Enhanced high crisis detection
high_crisis_validation = [
    "honestly thinking about ending it all",     # → HIGH (explicit suicidal ideation)
    "everyone would be better off without me",   # → HIGH (burden thoughts, boosted)
    "can't see any way out of this",            # → HIGH (hopelessness, enhanced)
    "really struggling and can't cope anymore"   # → HIGH (distress + inability, refined)
]

# Sophisticated context filtering
context_intelligence_tests = [
    "that raid boss absolutely killed our team",    # → NONE (gaming context, enhanced)
    "this deadline is literally killing me",        # → NONE (work stress, academic filter)
    "dead tired after that workout",               # → NONE (physical fatigue, improved)
    "killing it at this new job opportunity"       # → NONE (work success, refined)
]

# Learning system validation
learning_effectiveness_tests = [
    # After enhanced false positive learning:
    "this exam is going to kill me" + academic_context → NONE (learned pattern)
    
    # After improved false negative learning:
    "honestly not doing that well" + support_context → MEDIUM (enhanced sensitivity)
]
```
