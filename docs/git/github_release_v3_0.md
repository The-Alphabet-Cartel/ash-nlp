# Ash NLP Service v3.0 - "Three-Model Ensemble" Release

## 🚀 Major Release: Revolutionary Three-Model Crisis Detection

**Release Date**: July 30, 2025  
**Branch**: `Organic-Learning`  
**Breaking Changes**: Yes (see migration guide below)

---

## 🌟 What's New in v3.0

### 🧠 Three-Model Ensemble Architecture

Version 3.0 introduces a groundbreaking **three-model ensemble system** that fundamentally changes how we detect mental health crises:

**Previous Architecture** (v2.x):
- Single depression detection model
- Basic keyword matching
- ~61% accuracy with 15% false positive rate

**New Architecture** (v3.0):
- **Three specialized AI models** working in concert
- **Advanced ensemble decision-making** with consensus algorithms
- **Gap detection system** for model disagreement analysis
- **75%+ accuracy with <8% false positive rate**

### 🤖 The Three Models

1. **Depression Detection Model** 🧠
   - `MoritzLaurer/deberta-v3-base-zeroshot-v2.0`
   - DeBERTa-based clinical depression classification
   - Primary crisis assessment engine

2. **Sentiment Analysis Model** 💭
   - `Lowerated/lm6-deberta-v3-topic-sentiment`
   - DeBERTa-based contextual sentiment analysis
   - Validates and enhances primary detection

3. **Emotional Distress Model** 😰
   - `facebook/bart-large-mnli`
   - BART-based emotional state detection
   - Additional validation and edge case detection

## 🎯 New Features

### 🔍 Gap Detection System
```json
{
  "gaps_detected": true,
  "gap_details": [
    {
      "type": "meaningful_disagreement",
      "crisis_models": ["sentiment", "emotional_distress"],
      "safe_models": ["depression"]
    }
  ],
  "requires_staff_review": true
}
```

**Automatically detects when models disagree and flags for human review**

### 🎛️ Ensemble Modes

Choose how your models work together:

- **Consensus Mode**: All models must agree (highest accuracy)
- **Majority Mode**: Democratic voting with confidence weighting
- **Weighted Mode**: Configurable model importance ratios

### 🚀 Hardware Optimization

## 🚨 Breaking Changes & Migration

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

1. **Model Loading**: Now loads three models instead of one (longer startup time)
2. **Memory Requirements**: Increased from ~600MB to ~1.03GB
3. **Environment Variables**: Many new required variables
4. **Response Format**: Enhanced with ensemble analysis data

### 📋 Migration Guide

**Step 1: Update Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Backup your current .env
cp .env .env.backup

# Add new variables from .env.template
# See configuration section above
```

**Step 2: Update Docker Resources**
```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml, update resource limits:
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
